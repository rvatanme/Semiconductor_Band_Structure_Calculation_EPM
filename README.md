# Electronic Band Structure Calculation
Electronic band structure of a solid provides a set of possible energies that an electron might have with a wavevector of k in that solid. The variety of methods including Emprical Psuedopotential Methods (EPM), k.p perturbation theory, tight binding model, density functional theory, Green's function, etc for band structure calculation have been proposed. Among the many methods available, the EPM method, due to its short calculation runtime, has provided invaluable and practical tool in the design and modelling of modern electronic devices and semiconductor nanostrucre. Here three scripts written in C,C++ and python based on EPM model are provided that calculte the electronic band structure of a solid in diamond or zincblend crystal structure.
