# Electronic Band Structure Calculation
Electronic band structure of a solid provides a set of possible energies that an electron with a wavevector of k might have in that solid. The veriaty of methods for band structure calculations have been proposed including: Emprical Psuedopotential Methods (EPM), k.p perturbation theory, tight binding model, density functional theory, Green's function, etc. Among the many methods available, the EPM methods, due to its acceptable produced band structures in a short calculation runtime, has provided invaluable and practical tool in the design and modelling of modern electronic devices and semiconductor nanostrucre. Here three scripts written in C,C++ and python based on EPM model are provided that calculte the electronic band structure of a solid in diamond or zincblend crystal structure.
